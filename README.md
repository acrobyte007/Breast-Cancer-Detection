# Breast Cancer Prediction with KNN

## Introduction

This project aims to predict breast cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification method that can be used for medical diagnosis tasks.

## Dataset

The breast cancer dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic]. 

It includes features such as [radius1	texture1	perimeter1	area1	smoothness1	compactness1	concavity1	concave_points1	symmetry1	fractal_dimension1		radius3	texture3	perimeter3	area3	smoothness3	compactness3	concavity3	concave_points3	symmetry3	fractal_dimension3].

The target variable is [Diagnosis]. The dataset has been preprocessed normalize features.
